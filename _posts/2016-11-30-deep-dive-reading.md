_A reading list for getting very deep on Ethereum._

## [LeastAuthority/ethereum-analyses](https://github.com/LeastAuthority/ethereum-analyses)

-   This first public audit on Ethereum is a classic. Very deep impact and had clues to all major attacks on Ethereum so far, such as reentrancy hazards and gas economics. May you find the next major contributions and vulnerabilities on Ethereum, possibly using this resource for ideas and inspiration. (Don’t forget the Appendix.)

## [The "Yellow Paper": Ethereum's formal specification](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper)

-   _The_  formal specification of the Ethereum protocol. Yes [it could be clearer](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5eqggd/folks_gav_gave_you_a_spec_use_it), but until someone seizes the opportunity, it’s what’s there.

## [Ethereum Subtleties](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Subtleties/6e97c9cea49605264c6f4d1dc9e1939b1f89a5a3)

-   A lot of the subtleties of Ethereum. Blackhats don’t often lurk in the daylight of the obvious, but in the darkness of subtleties where much fewer whitehats roam. For example, one of the DoS attacks used “note: there is a difference between zero-balance and nonexistent!”

## [Long-term gas cost changes for IO-heavy operations to mitigate transaction spam attacks](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/150)

-   Phase 1 mitigation for transaction spam attacks

## [Simple replay attack protection](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/155)

-   Replay attack prevention

## [EXP cost increase](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/160)

-   EXP cost increase. Fixes the “last” mispriced opcode.

## [State trie clearing (invariant-preserving alternative)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/161)

-   State trie clearing to purge empty accounts from the chain
-   An earlier proposal is [https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/158](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/158)

## [Contract code size limit](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/170)

-   Limit the maximum size of contract code on the blockchain
